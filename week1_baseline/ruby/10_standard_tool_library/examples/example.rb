# Step 10 — The agent owns no tools.
#
# There is no `mud:` argument and no tool registration here, because boukensha
# has nothing of its own to register. Every tool this agent can call arrives
# from an MCP server listed in settings.yaml's `mcp_servers:` block — the MUD
# daemon, a filesystem server, anything that speaks MCP. Swapping what the
# agent can do is a config edit, not a code change.

#   BOUKENSHA_DIR=/path/to/.boukensha ruby examples/example.rb
#
# Point BOUKENSHA_DIR at a config that has an `mcp_servers: mud:` entry (the
# repo root's .boukensha does), and launch from the repo root so that entry's
# relative command path resolves.
